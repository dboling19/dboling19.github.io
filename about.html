      <p class="db-body">Finding a passion for IT development at a young age, I started out with basics of inventory management and robotics.  Finding a specific interest in data engineering, I continued finding new avenues for data management skills and developing software for it.</p>
      <p class="db-body">My first language was Lua, using it for basic terminal applications and learning the basics of variables, loops, functions, and general scripting practices.  Later I found the obvious similarities of Python an easy level up.  My first "professional" position was in college as a student technical assistant (STA).  My roles included general helpdesk customer support (resetting drivers, helping users and students with devices, etc.).  A year later being promoted to student technician, increasing my responsibilities to campus-wide office support and device repair.  In college I was approached by the IT Director for a web/software development opportunity, the language of choice being PHP.  I completed the training desired, and moved on to working on other projects within the college where I learned Symfony PHP, Doctrine, Twig, advanced SQL, and more under the IT Manager and Senior Developer.  After graduating my first real position outside of college was as a Private IT Contractor at Goshen City, developing the application seen under the "Projects" page.  </p>
